This project displays a list of NGOs, human rights groups, and other organizations I support.

As a big believer in the importance of human rights, I want to share the
organizations that I have donated to.

Additionally, I also wish to present several resources you can take advantage of and actions you
can take that will help support human rights and fight back against CCP rule.


## Usage

$ git clone https://github.com/leeway64/promoting-human-rights-a-collection-of-organizations-I-support.git
$ cd promoting-human-rights-a-collection-of-organizations-I-support

## Actions you can take to support human rights in China

![](doc/)

- **Attend or organize protests**: As a member of a vibrant democracy, you can make your voice heard by
attending or organizing protests against the CCP.
- **Contact your lawmakers**: If you are a citizen, then you have the privilege as a constituent of calling
your representatives in the US Congress. These senators and congresspeople take opinions from
constituents very seriously; letting them know that you support human rights and wish to push back
against China can help them know what their constituents are thinking and feeling.
  - For example, you can call or email your lawmakers to express your support for acts such as the
  [Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act](https://freedomhouse.org/article/united-states-freedom-house-applauds-passage-uyghur-forced-labor-prevention-act-urges-swift)
  or the [Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act](https://freedomhouse.org/article/united-states-freedom-house-applauds-passage-uyghur-human-rights-policy-act).
- **Donate to human rights groups**: There are several human rights groups that support human rights in 
China, as listed below. Donating to them truly makes a difference, no matter how small.

Ultimately, the Chinese Communist Party can cut all the flowers, but they can't
[stop the spring](https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/children-play-with-toy-guns-next-to-a-banner-put-up-by-news-photo/1232245573).
